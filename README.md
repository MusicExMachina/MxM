MxM is a Java-based musical API inteded for use in developing AI composers. These composers may be algorithmic, aleatoric, or even machine-learning based in nature- MxM is simply here to provide an interface between abstract concepts like keys and machine-readable music formats like MIDI and LilyPond. To this end, it is worth noting that MxM is designed with the Western musical tradition in mind, particularly equal temperament, fractional timing, and a delineation between form.time signatures and tempi. While other traditions, such as Indian raga, Javan gamelan, or even EDM may be generated, they are not the core of MxM developers' attention.
